                <h3>Lily J. Potter (born Evans) and James Potter</h3>
                <p>
                    Lily and James Potter, beloved parents of Harry Potter, were courageous members of the wizarding
                    world. Lily possessed remarkable magical abilities, known for her proficiency in charms. James, a
                    skilled
                    and charismatic wizard, was a member of the Order of the Phoenix, standing against the dark forces
                    led
                    by Lord Voldemort. Their selfless sacrifice to protect their son left an enduring legacy, as their
                    love
                    and bravery became instrumental in Harry's journey to defeat the Dark Lord.

                <p>
                    There are a lot of discussions about the actors who played them, because Harrys parents where 21
                    when they died, but their actors are a whole lot older, so instead of them I decided to take some
                    FanArt as

                    <h3>Petunia (born Evans), Vernon and Dudley Dursley</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Dursley family, headed by the uptight Vernon and his judgmental wife Petunia, epitomizes
                        narrow-mindedness and disdain for anything magical. Vernon is an overbearing, blustering man,
                        obsessed with maintaining an ordinary, "normal" life. Petunia, Lily Potter's sister, is cold and
                        spiteful, harboring jealousy and resentment towards her magical sibling. Dudley, their indulged
                        and spoiled son, mirrors his parents' disdain for Harry. The Dursleys' suburban existence
                        revolves
                        around conformity and a vehement rejection of anything supernatural, making them the stark
                        contrast to the magical world that Harry eventually embraces.
